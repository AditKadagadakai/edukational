            <strong> Edukational</strong> is an unique initiative to make
            quality education accessible to all the children from different
            financial backgrounds.

            It provides a platform through which students can access wide range
            of concepts and improve their learning. The language is easily
            understandable. Students can clarify their doubts there and then on
            a chat platform. <br />
            <br />
            Our endeavour is to connect the same with Government sponsored
            programs such as Skill India, Rashtriya Madyamik Shiksha Abhiyan and
            other future initiatives . This will provide greater accessability
            to students across India.

            Educational apps are expenive and not affordable to poor and
            underprivileged. Education has become a business for many service
            providers. Government should regulate education system by fixing a
            limit on thereby making it affordable to all the cross sections of
            the society. Edukational has made this possible. This website is
            informative and hassle free.

            As a parent, I am happy that my children can access the website and
            upgrade their learning without incurring a heavy expenditure.
            Restricting the screen time and raising an alert is a very distinct
            feature. This will significantly reduce the screen time of my
            children.
